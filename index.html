<h2>Leprecauhn or naw?</h2>
<ul>

<li><strong>High Concept:</strong>
A leprecauhn has been sent into a dreamlike state, not knowing how or when he got there. You must traverse this world until you come to your own conclusion.
</li>

<li><strong>Player Experience Goals:</strong>
Players should get a sense of satisfaction from collecting the shamrocks as constant words keep appearing to nag you constantly.
</li>

<li><strong>Genre:</strong>
Simple arcade style game.
</li>

<li><strong>Game play:</strong>
Use the four arrow keys to navigate through the maze and collect all of the shamrocks required to complete the game.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype goal:</strong>
The game is prototyping my use of game phases.
</li>

<li><strong>Features:</strong>
Nothing too flashy, just a simple Pac-Man style game. I was not able to get my own 'GameOver' phase to work correctly so the game infinitely loops back into itself.
</li>

<li><strong>Setting/Premise:</strong>
You are a leprecauhn that has found himself in a dreamlike state and cannot seem to remember how he got there. 
</li>

<li><strong>Story:</strong>
As he collects the shamrocks, thoughts of voices start filling his head, and the screen, making it harder for you to collect more shamrocks but entitling you to press forward until you get all of them and make it to the pot of gold.
</li>

<li><strong>Target Audience:</strong>
A few of my friends have played my game so far so they could be my target audience. Little kids and casual adults would probably enjoy it for its play time.
</li>

<li><strong>Play time:</strong>
A few minutes to collect all of the shamrocks.
</li>

<li><strong>Strategies:</strong>
No strategies can be made for this game yet but later when adding enemies strategies could be formulated.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Assets:</strong>
The pictures are all taken from Google and all rights reserved to those owners.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Closest Other Game:</strong>
Pac-Man.
